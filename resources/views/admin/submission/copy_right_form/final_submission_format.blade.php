            <p class="italic"><strong>Abstract: </strong> <span class="text-red">(11Bold)</span> Analgesia, one of the components of triad of anaesthesia, has now extended to relief of postoperative pain, chronic pain and cancer pain. The spinal cord has taken the center stage in analgesia practice and Spinal anaesthesia is the commonly used technique for lower limb surgeries as it is easy to administer, economical and causes less hemodynamic variation than general anaesthesia. Hence different additives can be used to increase the duration of postoperative analgesia. Since there are no studies comparing Buprenorphine and Nalbuphine, we have selected this study to evaluate the effect of intrathecal Bupivacaine with Buprenorphine compared with Nalbuphine for postoperative analgesia. <span class="text-red">(10)</span>

            <h3>I.  Introduction <span class="text-red">(11 Bold)</span></h3>
            <p>
                Diabetes is now commonly recognized as a coronary heart disease risk  equivalent1,2,3,4.This is mainly attributed to the high rates of dyslipidemia among diabetic patients which is believed to be one of the major factors accounting for the high percentage of deaths among diabetics due to cardiovascular disease (CVD)5.Numerous epidemiological studies and randomized controlled trials have documented the association between elevated LDL-C levels with increased CVD risk in both diabetic and non diabetic populations.6,7. Thus reducing LDL-C levels is the primary goal of therapy for diabetic dyslipidemia.5,8.Statins are considered the first pharmacological line of treatment of dyslipidemia in diabetic patients9. Lowering of LDL-C levels is thought to be the main beneficial effect of statin treatment.In India currently no guidelines available for treating diabetic dyslipidemia and no previous study has documented the efficacy.The current study aims to build growing awareness of atherosclerosis specific care of diabetes patient by examining efficacy of two most commonly prescribed statins in India. <span class="text-red">(10)</span>

            <h3>II. Material And Methods <span class="text-red">(11 Bold)</span></h3>
            <p>This prospective comparative study was carried out on patients of Department of general Medicine at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Combined Hospital, Vibhuti Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh from November 2014 to November 2015. A total 300 adult subjects (both male and females) of aged ≥ 18, years were for in this study.<span class="text-red">(10)</span><br>
            <strong>Study Design:</strong> Prospective open label observational study<br>
            <strong>Study Location:</strong> This was a tertiary care teaching hospital based study done in Department of General Medicine, at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Combined Hospital, Vibhuti Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.<span class="text-red">(10)</span></p>

                <strong>Study Duration:</strong> November 2014 to November 2015.<br>
                <strong>Sample size:</strong> 300 patients.<br>
                <strong>Sample size calculation:</strong> The sample size was estimated on the basis of a single proportion design. The target population from which we randomly selected our sample was considered 20,000. We assumed that the confidence interval of 10% and confidencelevel of 95%. The sample size actually obtained for this study was 96 patients for each group. We planned to include 300 patients (Group I- Control, Group II- Cases of 100 patients for each group) with 4% drop out rate.<span class="text-red">(10)</span><br>
                <strong>Subjects & selection method:</strong> The study population was drawn from consecutive diabetic patients who presented to Dr. Ram ManoharLohia Combined Hospital with dyslipidemia and were prescribed the indicated statins and underwent fasting blood test of lipid profile before statin treatment initiation between from November 2014 to November 2015. Patients were divided into three groups (each group had 100 patients) according to doses of statins. The prescribed doses of statin in RMLH for diabetic patients <span class="text-red">(10)</span><br>

            <strong>Statistical analysis <span class="text-red">(10) Bold</span></strong>
            <p>Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Student's t-test was used to ascertain the significance of differences between mean values of two continuous variables and confirmed by nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. In addition, paired t-test was used to determine the difference between baseline and 2 years after regarding biochemistry parameters, and this was confirmed by the Wilcoxon test which wasa nonparametric test that compares two paired groups. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were performed to test for differences in proportions of categorical variables between two or more groups. The level P < 0.05 was considered as the cutoff value or significance. <span class="text-red">(10)</span></p>

            <h3>IV. Discussion <span class="text-red">(11 Bold)</span></h3>
            <p>
                Dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes plays an important role in development of atherogenesis. The standarded of treatment for dyslipidemia have been statins.For the treatment of dyslipidemia the most commonly used statins are are atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. <span class="text-red">(10)</span></p>
            <p>
                The four major statin beneficiary groups have already been defined  by NCEP 2013 report.
                <br>
                There is a wealth of evidence suggesting that lowering low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both European and US guidelines for CVD prevention recommend the use statins as first-line therapy for dyslipidemia and specify target LDL-C levels.  Previously, a National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) report had proposed to lower target levels to even more aggressive LDL-C goals for very high-risk patients.<br>
                Despite the proven benefits of LDL-C reduction ,lipid managenent  is suboptimal and many patients fail to achieve recommended LDL-C goals11,12..Themost likely reasons for this are the use of agents with poor efficacy for LDL-C lowering and suboptimal dose titration.<br>
                Such aggressive LDL-C goals, however are  harder to achieve. The most effective statin at the lowest dose would represent a simple, effective treatment strategy, enabling more patients to achieve goals without the need for dose titration.<br>
                Rosuvastatin, at a dose of 20 mg, has demonstrated high efficacy for LDL-C lowering, enabling patients with hypercholesterolemia to achieve their lipid goals<sup>10,11</sup>.

            <h3>V.  Conclusion <span class="text-red">(11 Bold)</span></h3>
            <p>Rosuvastatin 20 mg on every other regimen had equal effect when compared to daily dose regimen of atorvastatin 40 mg &rosuvastatin 20mg.</p>
